            Mr. Kuszmaul grew up in Kansas, went to MIT in the 80’s, worked as a scientist at NASA in the 90’s and took care of 
            his children and learned to be a teacher in the 2000’s.  Since 2012 he has been working to make Paly Robotics a place 
            where people can be who they are, enabled by the wisdom and fruits of science and engineering. He is also a 6th degree 
            black belt in AIkido, the martial art of peace. His wife teases him about this, by asking him if he is aware of the 
            definition of the word “martial.”.

            Kenny is a senior and a three-year veteran of Team 8. He was formerly Lab Manager his sophomore year and Build Captain 
            his junior year. He was a FIRST Dean's List Semifinalist in 2016. As Team Captain, he will focus on moving the team 
            forward to inspire new members, expand its technical abilities, and to improve its own organizational structure. Kenny 
            enjoys random facts (did you know?), Mucho Mangoes (#youdidntseethiscoming), forklifts (not a certified operator), 
            rivets (of all varieties), cargo pants o_o, and wearing his 2014 robotics polo (:kenny:).

            Simran Pujji is a junior entering her third year on Team 8. She joined the build subteam in her freshman year and 
            has since held the role of co-summer camp lead and competition manager, but this hasn’t stopped her from working 
            on build projects when she can. When she is not working on robotics, she enjoys reading (and finishing homework). 
            Her favorite part of FIRST Robotics, besides build season, is attending competitions and seeing all of the robots 
            other teams made. She’s looking forward to another great year of FIRST Robotics with Team 8 :)

            he helps to develop methods to numerically track progress for their tasks and document the team’s progress. Finally, 
            he ensures projects execute correctly by coordinating hours and deadlines. Jonathan was previously the programming 
            team project manager, and is now the Zero Robotics captain, robot driver, and bike project lead. Outside of robotics, 
            he enjoys playing baseball, reading about foreign policy, and programming.

            Devin joined the team in 2015 as a freshman. Initially unsure what he wanted to do, he eventually settled on being a 
            part of the Build Team to help manufacture and assemble the robot. Sophomore year, in addition to continuing on the 
            Build Team, Devin organized and readied the tools and supplies to take to competitions as well as kept an eye on safety 
            while the build team was working. Throughout his Junior year, Devin hopes to bring the Build Team closer together and 
            continue to push members to refine and improve their skills.

            In 2014, a single veteran member had to teach the few freshmen who joined the programming team - one of 
            whom was Nihar. Since then, Nihar has worked to improve programming team's work and organization year after 
            year. This summer he was elected the software captain, and hopes to advance our code for the upcoming competitions 
            as well as organize better teaching and collaborative development.

            This process is split into four main phases: brainstorming and sketching, prototyping, CADing, and part drawings. After 
            the design team finishes the design of the robot, the part drawings are handed off to build team to manufacture the robot.

            Maya is a junior who joined Paly Robotics her freshman year as an animator and storyboard artist, 
            eventually becoming the Art Project Manager her sophomore year, before having to take up the mantle of Art 
            Captain when both her predecessors were brutally murdered. When not holding serious meetings at Tin Pot or 
            Kirk’s with the Art Team Leadership, she spends her time doing odd-jobs for Paly Theatre and her APUSH 
            homework. And yes, it is very funny that her name is Maya and the Art Team uses Autodesk Maya. In fact, it's 
            so funny that you should definitely make that joke to her face for the 9,999th time, because it hasn’t gotten 
            old by now at all. Ha. Ha. Ha.

            Shota Yamamoto is a junior on Team 8 and has been on the team since his sophomore year. He was originally on 
            business team, but realized that his true passion was being more hands on with the robot. While on business, 
            Shota helped find sponsors, and his hard work helped find the team food sponsors for build season. In addition, 
            he was the lead for the Spirit and Stanford Concessions committees. As the year progressed, he found himself 
            helping and organizing scouting and strategy at competitions, cage reorganization in the offseason and the PALY 
            Robotics summer camp. Hoping to make a difference on Team 8, he delved into all work he was given, and is the 
            reason he is our lab manager this year.

            Eddie joined the build subteam of Paly robotics during his freshman year. As a sophomore, he currently oversees 
            the pit, the place where the robot gets fixed during competition, and makes sure that it is well stocked to 
            fix the robot at anytime. He also makes sure that people are being safe when using machines or power tools. 
            During this coming year, he hopes to make a bigger impact on Team 8 and also make sure that everyone is safe 
            while constructing/fixing the robot.
