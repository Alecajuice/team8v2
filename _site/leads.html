She joined the build subteam in her freshman year and  has since held the role of co-summer camp lead and competition manager, but this hasn’t stopped her from working  on build projects when she can. When she is not working on robotics, she enjoys reading (and finishing homework).  Her favorite part of FIRST Robotics, besides build season, is attending competitions and seeing all of the robots  other teams made. She’s looking forward to another great year of FIRST Robotics with Team 8 :)
